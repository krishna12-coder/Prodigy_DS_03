# Prodigy_DS_03

numpy (np) and pandas (pd):

numpy is used for numerical computations in Python.
pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis, providing data structures like DataFrames.
train_test_split and GridSearchCV from sklearn.model_selection:

train_test_split is used to split datasets into train and test sets for model validation and testing.
GridSearchCV is for performing hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation to determine the best parameters for a model.
DecisionTreeClassifier from sklearn.tree:

DecisionTreeClassifier is an implementation of a decision tree classifier in Scikit-learn. It's used for classification tasks.
classification_report from sklearn.metrics:

classification_report generates a text report showing various classification metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score for a classifier's performance.
matplotlib.pyplot as plt:

matplotlib.pyplot is a plotting library in Python used to create visualizations.
tree from sklearn:

Specifically importing tree from sklearn allows you to visualize the decision tree.

sns.histplot(x="age", data=df, kde=True, hue="y"):

sns.histplot creates a histogram using Seaborn.
x="age" specifies that the 'age' column from the DataFrame df will be plotted.
data=df indicates that the data to be plotted comes from the DataFrame df.
kde=True adds a kernel density estimation to the histogram, showing the estimated probability density function.
hue="y" colors the histogram bars based on the values in the column 'y'. This parameter is useful when you want to distinguish different groups within your data.
plt.title("Age Distribution and Deposits\n"):

plt.title sets the title of the plot to "Age Distribution and Deposits" with a newline character at the end (\n) for spacing.
plt.show():

plt.show() displays the plot created using Seaborn and Matplotlib.


This code creates a histogram using Seaborn to display the distribution of ages based on the 'age' column from the DataFrame df. It uses the 'y' column to apply different colors to the histogram bars for distinct groups or categories. However, it seems there's a repetition in the code provided. If there's anything specific you'd like to ask or if you need a different explanation, feel free to let me know!


df.y.value_counts(): This method counts the occurrences of unique values in the 'y' column of the DataFrame df. It returns a Series object with the counts of each unique value in the 'y' column.

keys = df.y.value_counts().index: This line extracts the index (the unique values) from the Series obtained by value_counts(). These will be the labels for the pie chart.

data = df.y.value_counts().values: This line extracts the values (the count of occurrences) from the Series obtained by value_counts(). These values will be represented as portions of the pie chart.

plt.figure(figsize=(6,3.5)): This creates a new figure for the pie chart and sets its size to be 6 units wide and 3.5 units tall.

explode = [0,0.1]: The explode parameter is used in pie charts to "explode" or separate specific slices. Here, it's set to [0, 0.1], which means the second slice (index 1) will be slightly separated from the rest of the pie chart.

plt.pie(data, labels=keys, explode=explode, autopct='%.0f%%'): This creates the pie chart using Matplotlib's pie function.

data contains the counts of unique values in the 'y' column.
labels=keys assigns labels to each portion of the pie, taken from the unique values in the 'y' column.
explode=explode separates a particular slice (defined earlier).
autopct='%.0f%%' displays the percentage of each portion in the pie chart with no decimal places.
plt.show(): This displays the pie chart created using Matplotlib.
plt.figure(figsize=(23,10)): This sets up a figure for the heatmap, specifying its size to be 23 units wide and 10 units tall using Matplotlib.

sns.heatmap(df.corr(), cmap='bwr', annot=True):

sns.heatmap() is a Seaborn function that creates a heatmap.
df.corr() computes the correlation matrix of the numeric columns in the DataFrame df. The corr() function calculates pairwise correlation values between columns.
cmap='bwr' sets the color map to blue-white-red. This colormap (blue to red) represents the range of correlation values from negative to positive. Blue represents negative correlation, white represents no correlation, and red represents positive correlation.
annot=True adds numerical annotations to each cell of the heatmap, displaying the correlation values within the heatmap cells.
plt.show(): This command displays the heatmap generated by Seaborn and Matplotlib.

Computing the Confusion Matrix:

python
Copy code
cm = confusion_matrix(pred_y, test_y)
The confusion_matrix function from Scikit-learn's sklearn.metrics module computes a confusion matrix based on the predicted values (pred_y) and the actual true values (test_y).
Here, pred_y is assumed to contain the predicted target values, and test_y contains the actual (true) target values.
Displaying the Confusion Matrix:

ConfusionMatrixDisplay(cm, display_labels=clf.classes_).plot()
ConfusionMatrixDisplay is a class within Scikit-learn's sklearn.metrics module that allows for displaying the confusion matrix.
The ConfusionMatrixDisplay class takes the computed confusion matrix cm as input.
display_labels=clf.classes_ is used to specify the class labels for better interpretation of the confusion matrix. clf.classes_ is assumed to contain the class labels predicted by the classifier clf.
.plot() method is called on the ConfusionMatrixDisplay object to generate the plot of the confusion matrix.
Showing the Plot:
plt.show()
This line uses Matplotlib's plt.show() to display the plot created by ConfusionMatrixDisplay.  


Importing Required Libraries:


from sklearn import tree
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
This imports necessary modules: tree from Scikit-learn, which includes decision tree-related functionalities, and matplotlib.pyplot for plotting.
Setting up the Figure Size:


fig = plt.figure(figsize=(25, 20))
This line creates a Matplotlib figure with a specified size of 25 units in width and 20 units in height.
Preparing Feature Names:


feature_names = X.columns.tolist()
Assuming X is a DataFrame containing the features used for training the decision tree model (clf), this line extracts the column names of the features and converts them to a list. These will be used to label the nodes of the decision tree.
Plotting the Decision Tree:


tree.plot_tree(clf, filled=True, feature_names=feature_names)
tree.plot_tree() is a function in Scikit-learn used to visualize decision trees.
clf is assumed to be an instance of DecisionTreeClassifier that has already been trained.
filled=True fills the decision tree nodes with colors to indicate majority class.
feature_names=feature_names assigns the extracted feature names to the corresponding features in the tree.
Displaying the Plot:


plt.show()
This command displays the decision tree plot created using Matplotlib.
